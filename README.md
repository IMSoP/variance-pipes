Overview
--------

People are often confused by exactly when a class should be able to vary the contracts of its parent class, or an interface it inherits - something technically known as "covariance and contravariance".

Wikipedia has [quite a good explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)), but it's very wordy, so I had the idea for a more visual explanation: functions as boxes, linked by pipes.

This is a Work In Progress, but maybe it will help someone get the idea.
